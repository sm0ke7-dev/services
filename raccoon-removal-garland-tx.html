                <h2>Common Signs and Problems of Raccoon Infestation in Garland</h2>

                <p>Recognizing the early warning signs of <strong>raccoon infestation Garland</strong> can save you thousands of dollars in repair costs and prevent serious health hazards. Raccoons are primarily nocturnal animals, so most homeowners first notice their presence through distinctive sounds coming from attics, walls, or crawl spaces during nighttime hours.</p>

                <p>The most common indicators include heavy scratching, thumping, or chattering sounds overhead, particularly between dusk and dawn. You may also notice strong, musky odors emanating from affected areas, as raccoons mark their territory with scent and their droppings create persistent odor problems that worsen over time.</p>

                <div class="info-box warning">
                    <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warning Signs of Raccoon Presence</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Nocturnal noises</strong> - Scratching, thumping, chattering sounds in attics or walls</li>
                        <li><strong>Strong odors</strong> - Musky scents, urine smell, or decomposition odors</li>
                        <li><strong>Property damage</strong> - Torn roof shingles, damaged vents, chewed entry points</li>
                        <li><strong>Raccoon droppings</strong> - Dark, cylindrical feces often containing undigested food</li>
                        <li><strong>Visual sightings</strong> - Raccoons on roof, around garbage, or entering/exiting structures</li>
                        <li><strong>Disturbed garbage</strong> - Overturned trash cans, scattered debris, torn bags</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p><strong>Raccoon damage Garland</strong> properties experience typically follows predictable patterns based on these animals' natural behaviors. Raccoons use their dexterous front paws to manipulate latches, remove roof materials, and create entry points that often measure 4-6 inches in diameter. Once inside, they establish latrines in specific areas, leading to concentrated contamination that requires professional cleanup.</p>

                <p><strong>Attic raccoon removal</strong> situations often reveal extensive insulation damage, torn ductwork, and chewed electrical wires that create serious fire hazards. Female raccoons frequently choose attics as birthing dens, particularly during spring months, creating multi-generational infestations that can persist for months without professional intervention.</p>
