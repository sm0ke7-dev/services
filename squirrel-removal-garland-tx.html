                <p>The health hazards associated with squirrel infestations extend beyond property damage. Squirrels can carry various parasites, including fleas and ticks that transmit diseases to humans and pets. Their droppings and urine create unsanitary conditions that pose respiratory risks, particularly in enclosed spaces like attics where contamination can affect your home's air quality.</p>

                <p>Professional <strong>wildlife control Garland TX</strong> services provide comprehensive solutions that address immediate squirrel removal while implementing long-term prevention strategies.

                <h2>Common Signs and Issues of Squirrel Infestation in Garland</h2>

                <p>Identifying early indicators of <strong>squirrel infestation Garland</strong> can save homeowners thousands of dollars in repair costs and prevent serious structural damage. Squirrels are most active during daylight hours, particularly in early morning and late afternoon, making their presence more noticeable than nocturnal wildlife species.</p>

                <p>The most distinctive signs include persistent scratching, scurrying, and chattering sounds in attics, walls, or ceiling spaces during daylight hours. Unlike other wildlife, squirrels create continuous gnawing sounds as they chew through building materials, electrical wires, and stored items to maintain their ever-growing teeth.</p>

                <div class="info-box warning">
                    <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Signs of Squirrel Presence</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Daytime noises</strong> - Scratching, scurrying, chattering sounds in attics or walls</li>
                        <li><strong>Gnawing damage</strong> - Chewed wood, wires, plastic pipes, and stored items</li>
                        <li><strong>Entry holes</strong> - Round holes 2-4 inches diameter in soffits, vents, or roofing</li>
                        <li><strong>Squirrel droppings</strong> - Small, dark pellets scattered in attic or nesting areas</li>
                        <li><strong>Nesting materials</strong> - Shredded insulation, leaves, twigs in secluded areas</li>
                        <li><strong>Visual sightings</strong> - Squirrels entering/exiting structures or on rooftops</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p><strong>Squirrel damage Garland</strong> properties experience typically follows predictable patterns based on these animals' natural behaviors. Squirrels require constant gnawing to wear down their continuously growing incisors, leading them to chew electrical wires, wooden beams, plastic pipes, and even metal fixtures. This behavior creates serious fire hazards and can compromise your home's structural integrity.</p>

                <p><strong>Attic squirrel removal</strong> situations often reveal extensive insulation damage, contaminated areas from droppings and urine, and complex tunnel systems created by multiple squirrels over time. Female squirrels frequently establish nesting areas in attics during breeding seasons, typically twice yearly in spring and fall, leading to multi-generational infestations that require comprehensive professional intervention.</p>
