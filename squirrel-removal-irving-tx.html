                <h2>Common Signs and Issues of Squirrel Infestation in Irving</h2>

                <p>Identifying early indicators of <strong>squirrel infestation Irving</strong> can save homeowners thousands of dollars in repair costs and prevent serious structural damage. Squirrels are diurnal animals, most active during daylight hours, particularly in early morning and late afternoon when they forage for food and maintain their territories.</p>

                <p>The most distinctive signs include persistent scratching, scurrying, and chattering sounds in attics, walls, or ceiling spaces during daylight hours. Unlike nocturnal wildlife, squirrels create continuous activity sounds throughout the day, including distinctive gnawing noises as they chew through building materials, stored items, and electrical components to maintain their teeth.</p>

                <div class="info-box warning">
                    <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Signs of Squirrel Presence</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Daytime noises</strong> - Scratching, scurrying, chattering sounds in attics or walls</li>
                        <li><strong>Chewing damage</strong> - Damaged wood, wiring, plastic pipes, and stored items</li>
                        <li><strong>Entry holes</strong> - Round openings 2-4 inches diameter in soffits, vents, or roofing</li>
                        <li><strong>Droppings accumulation</strong> - Small, dark pellets in nesting and feeding areas</li>
                        <li><strong>Nesting materials</strong> - Shredded insulation, fabric, paper in secluded spaces</li>
                        <li><strong>Visual sightings</strong> - Squirrels entering/exiting structures or on rooftops</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p><strong>Squirrel damage Irving</strong> properties experience typically follows predictable patterns based on natural behavioral needs. Squirrels require constant gnawing to control continuously growing incisors, leading them to destroy electrical wiring, wooden support beams, plastic plumbing components, and even metal fixtures. This destructive behavior creates serious safety hazards and can compromise your home's structural integrity over time.</p>

                <p><strong>Attic squirrel removal</strong> situations often reveal extensive contamination from droppings and urine, torn insulation used for nesting material, and complex tunnel systems created through walls and ceiling spaces. Female squirrels establish breeding areas in protected spaces twice yearly, typically in spring and fall, leading to multi-generational infestations requiring comprehensive professional intervention.</p>
